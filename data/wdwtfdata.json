      "AboutText1":"Web development can seem pretty daunting when you consider the multitude of technologies out there. This site aims to give you a comprehensive overview of the subject to help you bring everything into context.",
      "AboutText2":"Once you understand how everything fits together and the different development options available to you, you'll find the subject much easier to grasp.",
      "AboutText3":"You'll get a better idea of what you need to learn and we'll point you to some great places to do that. There are plenty of free resources out there and you are sure to find something that fits your style of learning. All you need is a text editor, and you're ready to go.",
      "AuthorText1":"Steve Hampson was a child of the home computer era, the golden age of the ZX Spectrum and Commodore 64. He studied computer science at sixth form where he developed a system using licensed data from the Admiralty to track updates to nautical charts. Although this was his official 'A' Level project he also wrote a simple expert system in RM Basic under the name 'flipinec'. Flipinec was a short program with less than 100 lines of code but it allowed the user to create and play 'Choose your own adventure' style stories. The was a massive hit amongst his peers, with half the sixth form writing and playing each others stories.",
      "AuthorText2":"After gaining a bachelors degree at Staffordshire University in 1994, Steve's early career saw him programming in Lansa code and various long-obsolete desktop database systems. Gradually Steve became something of a MS Access guru, using it as a front-end to Oracle or SQLServer databases. After the Y2K millenium bug Steve secured a contract with Land Rover to develop a prototype international dealer network database across the principal brands of the Premier Automotive Group with his work being presented to the likes of Bill Ford, Bob Dover, Wolfgang Reitzle and Gerrit Jan de Weerd - giants in the industry.",
      "AuthorText3":"Contract work involved a lot of travel, and with a young daughter and son at home Steve needed something more local and as luck would have it, his old position at the University of Northampton became available. It was a great opportunity to re-connect with past colleagues, but the work was largely centred around support and maintenance of third party systems from Agresso Software, work which he found dull and unchallenging. In 2011, due to restructuring, two developer roles were being lost and Steve didn't have the heart to compete against his colleagues for a job he didn't enjoy, so he accepted voluntary redundancy.",
      "AuthorText4":"After a failed attempt to set up a business selling Lego on Ebay, Steve fell into a severe depression for many years but eventually visited his GP who prescribed SRI medication. This would be the first steps towards recovery and soon he began to see a therapist to better understand the psychology and how to manage this somewhat mysterious illness. It was a slow road to recovery and Steve still felt unready to face work-life, so he turned to the crowd-funding site Kickstarter and produced a number of small projects over a three year period.",
      "AuthorText5":"During the Kickstarter years Steve learned digital modelling and sculpting and wrote two tutorial books on the subject, other projects included a chess-like boardgame called 'Gaons & Golems'; playing card decks; and a collection of his fanzine 'GLarg!' which he produced as a teenager. His final year on Kickstarter saw him develop a series of monthly and weekly PDF publications cleverly generated by a MS Access database, by this time Steve was developing systems and working a 40 hour week to meet deadlines, he was ready to go back to work!",
      "AuthorText6":"Whilst Steve had been away the industry had moved on and the old client-server architecture had been replaced by modern web deployed systems, he was out of date. After contemplating shelf-stacking and factory work, Steve decided to investigate this new development tech and after three months of videos, tutorials and Google-ing he managed to retrain himself and the result is this website. While acting as a test and demonstration of his skills, this site also hopes to pass on some of the wisdom he has gained to help others in the first steps of web development.",

      "heading":"Introduction - An overview of web development",
      "brief":"Web development combines a number of different technologies to build a public-facing, web-deployed application. There are thousands of technologies to choose from but most do the same thing in slightly different ways. Understanding the five principal roles in web development will provide you with a context to better understand this multitude of tech.",
      "paragraph1":"In it's simplest form, a website can be a single HTML file written with a text editor such as notepad, however in modern web development it is more common to see web applications connected to a back-end data source with a high level of styling. The popularity of smaller devices such as smartphones and tablets has further created a need to make web applications flexible to look good and perform well on any device. It is now quite common for web development to be split into several sections to be tackled individually, possibly by different personnel or teams.",
      "paragraph2":"The three core sections are the front-end which includes all code which will be run from the device browser, the back-end which includes all code which will be run from the web server, and the database which includes all the data structures needed to support the application and any code which will run on the database server.",
      "paragraph3":"There are two other sections which act in a supporting role to the core. Web Design focusses on the aesthetics and intuitiveness of the application and separates this from the actual coding of the front-end, while Developer Operations (Dev Ops) supports the development process by taking care of things like security, testing, release scheduling, deployment and many other tasks which would otherwise be handled by the core development staff.",
      "summary":"Web development is not difficult but can be complicated, by understanding the different concepts and stages involved you can select the technologies which are right for you and not get bogged down in all the other stuff you don't need."

    {
      "header":"Websites, applications, programs and systems",
      "heading":"Websites, applications, programs and systems - Understand the terminology.",
      "brief":"Web Development is full of strange terminology, when you come across a term you haven't heard before Google it or look for it in our Glossary section, it will only take a few minutes to understand what it means and how it fits into the scheme of things. Never be put off by strange words and acronyms.",
      "paragraph1":"A Web page refers to a single HTML document which sits in a domain (basically a folder). A Web Site refers to a collection of web pages which work together in the same domain (the same folder or subfolders), this would also include all supporting files such as images and video, and additional coding files such as JavaScript and CSS files.",
      "paragraph2":"An application is something which performs a certain set of tasks, for example a Payroll Application would encompass all the tasks required to fulfil a payroll function. Application can refer to what the thing does or the set of software which does it. An application may consist of different files, in different languages, in different locations. A Web Application is an application which is accessed via a web browser.",
      "paragraph3":"The term program is used to identify a single piece of code. This may be simple linear coding or a collection of subroutines (often called functions, procedures or methods) which together perform a certain function, or set of functions. A program could be an application in it's own right, but more often an application will comprise of several programs each of which fulfil a part of the applications functionality. The term system generally refers to a higher level, with a system collecting several related applications, such as a Human Resources system which include a payroll application.",
      "summary":"Web development has a whole universe of terminology related to different technologies and concepts, a basic understanding of what each strange term means is the key to understanding how everything fits together. Think of it like a jigsaw, each piece you add enriches the whole picture. You don't need a detailed knowledge, in fact you will only need to learn a small subset of the web development universe, but knowing the basics will bring a much-needed context and make it all feel less intimidating."

      "header":"The old way",
      "heading":"The old way - Desktops, Terminals and Client-Server.",
      "brief":"The computer has existed for around a century (depending on your definition), home computing around 50 years. The internet became popular around 25 years ago the same time smartphones began to appear. These quantuum leaps in the field brought new users into the field, and with them an exponential rise in programing languages or platforms and development methods.",
      "paragraph1":"In the early days, much of the programing was linear code using conditions (If Then Else), looping (Do While, For Next), and subroutines (Goto, Gosub). In these days computing was largely regarded as a means to perform complicated mathematics and algorithms which would be impractical or laborious for a human mind. A single computer would serve one or more users via a dumb terminal which would connect screens, keyboards and printers to the computer via a wired network. When used with multiple terminals, the computer became known as a Server.",
      "paragraph2":"As business computers started to become popular (a little ahead of home computers), client-server architecture was developed. The server still acted as the main computing unit and central data storage area, but some of the code would run on the users computer, this was called Client Software, the users PC being the client. Client software needed to be installed on each PC, this became known as the front-end. The server would host the data and also perform much of the data-processing being more powerful than the client PC.",
      "paragraph3":"With the introduction of the Intranet (not public) and Internet, the Web Browser became a common-client available to the public across different devices such as Mac and PC and the newly emerging SmartPhones. This was still essentially a Client-Server setup, but instead of developing a complete client software package, software could be developed using the browsers pre-packaged functionality. The browser language was HTML (HyperText Markup Language) which was essentially a rich text format which brought multi-media and links into a text document, along with formatting controls.",
      "summary":"Computers and programing go hand in hand, as the computer technology improves, the software expands exponentially. Technology is now very accessible to most of the 8 billion humans on the planet, many of whom have new ideas and new ways to use the technology, this fuels the continuous development of computing practices and methods and while things seem complex now, it's only likely to get even more complex, but technology is intended to improve things and make things easier which is why we are now seeing the framework layer appearing to bridge over the complexities."

      "header":"The new way",
      "heading":"The new way - Device, Webserver, Database.",
      "brief":"Developing for the web makes a website immediately available to anyone, anywhere, on any device. This is clearly an amazing step forward but brings with it greater concerns for data security and load handling. A middle layer was needed to act as a gatekeeper between the server and the world wide web, the web server fulfils that role.",
      "paragraph1":"Web development introduced the web server into the client-server model. Effectively the public access client software which runs on the webserver, this is called middleware and is considered to be back-end. As server tasks were delegated to the client in client-server architecture, so the webserver delegates much of the code to run on the client device using the browser as the interface while the webserver provides the interaction with the backend data within a private network (not accessible to the public).",
      "paragraph2":"Since the home computer era, graphical capabilities started to develop and by the internet era visual styling had become far more important. Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) was introduced to add a greater level of visual flair to websites, around this time the standards agency ECMA introduced a standard coding language to be packaged with browsers to allow programatic functionality to be added to websites, this became known as JavaScript and completes the holy trinity of HTML,CSS and JavaScript.",
      "paragraph3":"The science of web development is community driven, because a huge number of people are using the same core languages of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, individuals and companies share code snippets for the mutual benefit of the development community. These code snippets perform a certain common function, the collection together of several of these code snippets forms a library, by combining a library with a methodology (or way of doing things) we create the basis of a framework. Frameworks make web development easier by providing a set of pre-existing functionality and methods to everyone.",
      "summary":"The breaking down of computing applications into three sections (client, webserver and database) brings three seperate technologies each with countless variations. This creates a mind-boggling array of languages, methodologies and technologies, but essentially they are all doing the same thing in slightly different ways. You don't need to master everything, just your chosen selection of technologies, this is known as a tech-stack. A basic knowledge of the web development universe is needed to choose a tech-stack but this is continuously changing and developers must be flexible to adapt to new technologies."

      "RoadmapParagraph1":"A roadmap describes a pathway to learning the many technologies of web development. Some things need learning in order, others have several options to choose from, and a huge number are purely optional. By understanding the master roadmap you can develop your own personal roadmap which gives you a clear path to the technologies you need to master.",
      "RoadmapParagraph2":"This roadmap shows the full spectrum of web development, from front-end to back-end to underlying data source. This is known as 'full-stack' development but this is often broken down into five main roles - Web Designer, Front-end Developer, Back-end Developer, Database Developer, and Dev Ops.",
      "RoadmapParagraph3":"The Web Designer creates the User Interface and User Experience, a high level description of the system; the Front-End Developer codes this design; the Back-End developer codes an interface between the front-end and the under-lying data sources; the Database Developer creates the structure of those data sources; Dev Ops are the team who manage everything and are responsible for things like testing, deployment and security.",
      "RoadmapLegend":"This is a master roadmap, use it to create your own roadmap personalised to your requirements.",
