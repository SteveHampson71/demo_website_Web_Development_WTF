# Demo Website: Web Development WTF?

A demo website taking a light-hearted look at the world of web development.  
A learning experience which can also be informative.

## Technologies used
- HTML  
- CSS / SCSS  
- JavaScript  
- PHP  

## About this project
This website was built as a **hands-on experiment** to explore front-end development and dynamic content.  
It was developed under time constraints and should be considered a work in progress.  
The content is populated via a **homemade CMS** (stored in a separate repository).  
I aim to adopt **best practices for security and accessibility** as the project evolves,  
and hope this may eventually become a useful tool for those looking to learn about web development.  
It’s designed to be playful, informative, and a space for me to test ideas while learning by doing.

## What’s inside
- Front-end pages with HTML, CSS, JS, and PHP  
- Examples of interactive elements, layouts, and experiments
